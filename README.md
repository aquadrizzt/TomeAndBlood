Tome And Blood: More Options for Wizards and Sorcerers v1.1

## Overview

Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality. 
 
##Features

COMPONENT 20: Revised Dragon Disciples

Dragon Disciples are powerful sorcerers with dragons' blood somewhere in their lineage. Their magical talents bring out their draconic heritage, allowing them to cast powerful magical spells and exhibit dragon-like abilities.

-- d6 Hit Die. The Dragon Disciple rolls a d6 instead of a d4 whenever a new hit die is earned.<br />
-- Elemental Affinity. Dragon Disciples are attuned to one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. They gain a +50% bonus to resistance against that damage type and they also deal +25% more damage of the selected type.<br />
-- Scales. While not wearing armor, the Dragon Disciple may subtract their charisma modifier from their base armor class.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Dragon Disciple gains one fewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />

COMPONENT 25: Magus

A student of both arcane knowledge and martial prowess, a Magus blends together spell and steel to devastating effect. The most defining quality of a magus is their ability to cast complicated arcane spells while wearing even the heaviest armors.

-- d8 Hit Die. The Magus rolls a d8 instead of a d4 whenevera new Hit Die is earned.<br />
-- Specialization. The Magus may achieve, but not exceed, Specialization in any melee weapon, as well as two-handed and single weapon styles.<br />
-- Weapons and Armor. The Magus may use any melee weapon and wear any armor, including helmets.<br />
-- Armored Caster. The Magus may cast spells whilewearing any kind of armor.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Magus gains one fewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />
-- One-Handed Casting. The Magus suffers a -2 penalty tocasting speed and may not use shields.<br />

PLEASE NOTE: in order to let the Magus kit cast spells in armor, it is necessary to make armor equippable by mages and sorcerers. They still cannot *cast spells* in armor - only the Magus kit can do that. But they can equip armor if they are willing to have their spellcasting disabled.

COMPONENT 31: Favored Soul

Favoured Souls attribute their magical powers to the blessing of some divine being. This blessing grants them potent magical protections, as well as access to spells usually beyond the reach of Sorcerers.

-- Divine Spells. After character creation, the Favoured Soul may select a single divine sphere, granting them arcaneversions of the divine spells from the selected sphere.<br />
-- Protected. The Favoured Soul is always under the effectsof a protection from evil spell, granting a +2 bonus to ArmorClass and saving throws against evil foes, as well as protection from summoned fiends.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Favoured Soul gains onefewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />

COMPONENT 33: Sylvan Disciple

The capricious nature of the fey runs in the veins of Sylvan Sorcerers due to some long forgotten intermingling of fey blood or magic. These sorcerers are more emotional than most, prone to bouts of joy and rage.

-- Non-detectable. The Sylvan Disciple is always under the effects of a non-detection spell, providing immunity to detection via minor divination magic.<br />
-- Feyblooded. The Sylvan Disciple has a +4 bonus to saves vs. spells and is immune to charm.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Sylvan Disciple gains one fewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />

COMPONENT 35: Revenant Disciple

The taint of the grave runs through the families of Revenant Disciples. Perhaps one of their ancestors became a powerful lich or vampire, or maybe they were born dead before suddenly returning to life. Either way, the forces of death move through them and touch their every action.

-- d6 Hit Die. The Revenant Disciple rolls a d6 instead of a d4 whenever a new Hit Die is earned.<br />
-- Immunities. The Revenant Disciple is immune to sleep and death magic.<br />
-- Deathly Resilience. The Revenant Disciple has a +4 bonus to saves vs. death.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Revenant Disciple gains one fewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />

COMPONENT 37: Amorphous Disciple

The foul ichor of oozes runs through your veins, granting you magical control over noxious chemicals and slime, as well as a gift for changing your form to suit your needs.

-- Immunities. The Amorphous Disciple is immune to poison and disease.<br />
-- Shifting Form. The Amorphous Disciple has a +4 bonus to saves vs. polymorph.<br />
-- Oozeborn. The Amorphous Disciple is protected from hostile oozes, preventing the Amorphous Disciple from being attacked or targeted by oozes.<br />
-- Reduced Spellcasting. The Amorphous Disciple gains one fewer spell slot for each spell level they can cast.<br />

COMPONENT 40: Revised Specialists

This component gives each specialist kit some active or passive innate abilities that represent their mastery over their particular school of magic.  Additionally, specialists gain the ability to spontaneously convert any of their memorized spells into a spell from their specialty school of one level lower.  The special abilities are:
- Abjurer: when you cast a spell protection, it automatically creates a Spell Shield for free.<br />
- Conjurer: if SR is installed, you can cast Monster Summoning spells as if they are one level lower. In the absence of SR, you get bonus innate versions of the vanilla Monster Summoning spells.<br />
- Diviner: IIRC, you get innate (and early) access to Contingency. Might also be able to insert one extra spell into contingencies (two spells in Contingency, three in Chain Contingency).<br />
- Enchanter: the enchanter and all nearby allies get a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells.<br />
- Illusionist: you can use the Shadow Step ability, and have permanent Non-Detection.<br />
- Invoker: your spells do 20% more fire, cold, electric and magic damage.<br />
- Necromancer: you can innately use a modal ability to slow or control nearby undead. Also, you get innate abilities similar to (but better than) the Chill Touch, Ghoul Touch, and Vampiric Touch spells.<br />
- Transmuter: you get an innate ability to temporarily create and control a golem.<br />

COMPONENTS 51, 52, 53, 54: Innate Metamagic

These components make spell sequencers and contingencies into innate abilities (Chain Contingency becomes an HLA) so they don't cost spell slots; but "filling" them with spells still uses the spell slots associated with those spells.  These four components differ according to how you get metamagic:
-- 51: all arcane casters get sequencer and contingency abilities automatically<br />
-- 52: only mages and bards (not sorcerers) get sequencer and contingency abilities automatically<br />
-- 53: sequencer and contingency abilities are learned from scrolls, and can also be learned during character generation and by sorcerers<br />
-- 54: sequencer and contingency abilities can only be learned from scrolls<br />

COMPONENT 66: Innate Find Familiar

This component makes Find Familiar an innate ability and replaces its scrolls with scrolls of Magic Missile.

COMPONENTS 71, 72: Spell Switching for Sorcerers

This gives you an innate ability to switch out one of your known spells.  You can choose whether to get the ability once every level, or once every three levels.  In order for this to work, you will have to choose known spells from an item ability, like multiclass sorcerers, rather then in the traditional level-up screens.  Make sure you install this component after any other sorcerer kit mods!

PLEASE NOTE: I'll say it again - with this component installed, sorcerers pick spells from an item ability under the 'backpack' icon on the main screen, instead of picking spells from the normal character generation and level-up screens.

COMPONENT 80: Multiclass Sorcerers

What it says on the tin :O

PLEASE NOTE: multiclass sorcerers cannot use the normal sorcerer spell-learning screen - that is hard-coded. Instead, you have to use an ability from your item abilities (the backpack icon in the main game screen) which will let you pick one spell. Use this ability as often as necessary to fill out your known spells. And remember to use it after you level up!

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: multiclass sorcerers' casting slots are governed by MXSPLSRC.2da, just like the regular sorcerer. However, any changes to that file must be made BEFORE you install multiclass sorcerers. So if you like to change spell tables with Tweaks Anthology or something like that, make sure you do the spell-table-changing portion of that mod before installing Tome & Blood.

INSTALLATION NOTE: installation of this component will also automatically install the Revised Idenitfy spell and convert spell sequencers and contingencies to pick from any known spell, instead of from any memorized spell (changes which are necessary to work with these casters).

COMPONENT 82: Arcanist

This is a wizard kit that prepares and casts spells according to the D&D 5E rules. If you are not familiar, it achieves a hybrid status between the BG2 mage and sorcerer by differentiating "spell preparation slots" from "spellcasting slots." The Arcanist learns spells from scrolls, like any wizard, and has spell preparation slots according to the standard wizard spell table (MXSPLWIZ.2da). In order to actually prepare spells, the Arcanist must use a "Prepare Spells" innate ability before resting. Upon waking, they will be able to use spellcasting slots to cast their prepared spells spontaneously, like a sorcerer.  If you want to cast the same spells the next day, then no action is needed; after resting your spellcasting slots will be restored. If you want to cast different spells the next day, you must again use the the "Prepare Spells" ability just before resting, which will give you access to your preparation slots and allow you to fill them with a different set of spells.

The Arcanist's preparation slots are governed by MXSPLWIZ.2da; any changes you make to the standard wizard spell table will affect how many spells an Arcanist can prepare. The Arcanist's spellcasting slots are set to roughly match the unmodded spell slots of a Dragon Disciple. If you want to change this, you can modify "TomeandBlood/data/arcanist/D5CSTARC.2da" before installing the mod.

Installation of this component will also automatically install the Revised Identify spell and convert spell sequencers and contingencies to pick from any known spell, instead of from any memorized spell (changes which are necessary to work with these casters).

**DO NOT INSTALL THIS COMPONENT** if you plan to install the "5E-Style Spellcasting" mod. That mod basically applies the Arcanist spellcasting style to every spellcaster (except sorcerers and shamans). This would make the Arcanist entirely moot as a kit, and installing both on top of each other might cause technical problems.

COMPONENT 93: Bonus Spell Slot Items Work With Multiclass Sorcerers and Arcanist

Items like the Ring of Wizardry work by giving bonus spell slots to mages and bonus casting slots to sorcerers. Since Arcanists, multi-sorcerers, and other 5E-style casters are, as a technical matter, a species of wizard, this means tose items will increase your memorization slots but not your casting slots. This component will change such items to give casting slot bonuses to Arcanists, multi-sorcerers, and other 5E casters. 

Due to certain limitations, this can only allow each item to grant a +1 bonus at any given spell level. So for the sake of balance, all bonus-slot items will be modified to give a +1 bonus at their respective spell levels. This will notably change Edwin's Amulet in bg2 to give +1 spell per level instead of +2. Also BG2's Ring of Acuity, which usually grants +2 2nd-level spell slots, will instead grant +1 2nd-level slot. It may similarly change a few items in IWDEE.

The "double spell slots" items, specifically the "Evermemory" Ring of Wizardry in BG1 and Kontik's & Edion's Rings of Wizardry in IWDEE, will work as normal for normal spellcasters and sorcerers; and for 5E-style casters and multiclass sorcerers they will get a once-per-day item ability to refresh all casting slots of the relevant levels. This way they can achieve their original design, doubling your spellcasting slots, even with these new technical limitations.

COMPONENT 95: Multiclass Specialists

This component makes all of the specialist mage kits available in all of the fighter/mage, cleric/mage, and mage/thief kit screens. It does however adhere to the usual racial restrictions for both class access and kit access - so in an otherwise-unmodded game you will only see an effect with elves and half-elves.

If you use a mod to broaden access to wizard multiclasses at the class or kit level, this component should be installed afterward.
