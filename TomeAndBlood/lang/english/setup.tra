This ability causes the spells cast against the wizard to be deflected harmlessly away. It blocks a total of 2 spell levels, including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities (but excludes area effects that are not aimed directly at the wizard). As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be absorbed. If it tries to absorb a spell that over 2nd level, the spell will fail and the Deflection will be disrupted.~

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel a spell protections that has been erected, such as Minor spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Minor Spell Turning. The target's Magic Resistance does not affect this spell.  This ability can dispel protections of a level equal to the caster's level divided by three, rounded up.

By casting this spell, the priest channels a bolt of divine energy against the target. No attack roll is needed. Creatures struck suffer varying damage, depending on their plane of origin:
 Creature Type                       Damage
 Prime Material Plane            6d6
 Elemental planes                 3d4
 Undead creatures                 8d6
 Fiends                               10d6
The divine bolt also has the power to dispel a wizard's spell protection (such as Spell Deflection or Spell Turning), though it is not powerful enough to disrupt a Spell Trap.~

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower. Spells affected by this are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, and Spell Shield. 

Additionally, the target must save vs. spells or be deafened for 5 rounds, resulting in a 50% chance of miscast magic. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of any level affecting the target creature. The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled.

Additionally, if the target fails a save vs. spells, the target will be blinded by the Ruby Ray for 3 rounds. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Finally, Pierce Shield will cancel the target's magical combat protections, such as Shield or Stoneskin (but specific protections, such as Resistance to Fire, will remain).

Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.~

This spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed, making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if hit by a Flame Arrow (a 3rd-level spell), the caster will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell of up to 3rd level in power. It excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be reflected back upon the caster. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, a spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed and will exhaust the protection.

This spell will absorb and protect against a total of 5 spell levels of magic directed at the caster. It will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

This spell creates an incredibly powerful barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard is protected by Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), the wizard will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell up to 3rd level in power. 

The Spell Trap is remarkably stable, remaining in place for 4 hours unless dispelled or exhausted. It provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to four missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. The spell fires two missiles at 1st level, three at 5th level, and a maximum of four at 9th level.~
@6098   = ~Sorcerer~
@6099   = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May not place any slots in any fighting style.
– May cast arcane spells.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.

A Grease spell causes the surface of the ground to take on a slippery, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.~

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~

Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. This spell showers glittering golden particles in the area of effect. Enemies must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts, superheats them, and then hurls fiery bolts at opponents at very high speed. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -4.~

This spell creates a double of the caster formed from pure shadow, and imparts upon it some degree of form and autonomy. Blurry and shapeless, this entity will fight on the caster's behalf and remain in relatively stable form for up to 9 hours (unless it meets a violent demise).~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. The sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. (This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.) The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~

Area of Effect: Special

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster becomes a Grand Master in the use of the weapon. It acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~

Level: 4

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole.

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. It sprays a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~
@6130  = ~Mirror Image

Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts (one for every two experience levels, up to a maximum of five arrows at level 10), superheats them, and then hurls them at opponents at very high speed. Each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage plus 2d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. breath at -2. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the wizard, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within range.~

Upon contact, the target must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster, until the spell duration expires or the sword is dispelled. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own once each round, inflicting 5d4 damage when it hits a target. It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it is vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~

Area of Effect: Special

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently.  These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill.  These effects last for 1 hour.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

When a necromancer uses this ability, a blue glow encompasses his hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d4+1 points of cold damage and must save vs. Death or be Slowed and lose three points of Strength for two rounds. 

Undead touched by this energy are Held for two rounds. They do not receive a savign throw to avoid the effect.~
@6253   = ~Ghoul Touch~
@6254   = ~Ghoul Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch, the spell inflicts 1d4+1 points of magic damage. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. death, the spell continues to do 1d4 damage in the second round and 1d3 damage in the third round. Furthermore, the victim is paralyzed for 1 round and infected with a disease that saps his Strength, Dexterity and Constitution by two points each for five rounds.~
@6255   = ~Vampiric Touch~
@6256   = ~Vampiric Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, his hand is encompassed by a pale blue fire. Anyone successfully attacked by the necromancer loses 1d6+1 hit points, while the necromancer gains 1d6+1 hit points (any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points, lasting for 4 turns). Upon failing a saving throw vs. death with a -2 penalty, the victim loses 1d6 more hit points and also suffers a loss of 3 points of Constitution for one turn. 

Any undead touch by the necromancer while this ability is active are placed under the necromancer's control for five rounds.~

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 1d4+1 points of damage, while the mage gains 1d4+1 hit points. For every three levels of the caster, the draining repeats one round later. The maximum duration of five rounds is reached by 12-level necromancers.

If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: vs. Death

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard launches a magical attack against the vitality of an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim's Strength score is automatically reduced by 4 points for the duration of the spell. Additionally, if the target fails a saving throw vs. Death, the Strength penalty is doubled to -8, and the victim suffers the effects of a Slow spell (half movement rate and -4 penalties to thac0 and AC). These effects last for 1 turn.~
@6351   = ~Contingency~
@6352   = ~Contingency
Upon using this ability, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of his Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% max Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.~

This spell creates a rough facsimile of the caster, recognizable though not perfect. (Maybe I'll add a Blur visual effect to the clone.) The shadow clone has the equivalent of 60% of the experience (level, hit dice, skills, etc.) of the original caster, and can replicate some small amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast 1st level spells. The shadow clone cannot engage in melee combat or make use of any magical "items" it has equipped.

This spell is cast very quickly, creating a reasonable copy of the caster that can be perceived by all five senses of any onlookers. The clone has the equivalent of 60% of the experience (level, hit dice, skills, etc.) of the caster, and can replicate a moderate amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast up to 3rd level spells. The clone cannot engage in melee combat or make use of any magical "items" it has equipped. At the time the clone is created, the caster is rendered invisible for 60 seconds. Onlookers who do not carefully scrutinize the effect might easily believe the clone IS the caster, and the caster may use the distraction to escape or move to some advantageous position.

This is an improvement on the Misleading Clone spell. The simulacrum created has 60% of the experience (level, hit dice, skills, etc.) of the caster, but can replicate all of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any spells that the caster could at the clone's reduced level. The simulacrum also has enough substance and stability to engage in melee combat, but cannot use any magical "items" it has equipped.

Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible, except the charmed person cannot be compelled to violence.

If the charmed person is harmed, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed. 

Anyone who has been the target of this spell - whether they make their saving throw or not - will be suspicious for a time, and cannot be affected by it for 8 hours.

The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.

Anyone who has been the target of this spell - whether they make their saving throw or not - will be suspicious for a time, and cannot be affected by it for 8 hours.

The caster of this spell gains a temporary insight into the history and nature of magical objects. This translates into a temporary Lore bonus of 20 points, plus an additional 20 points for each five levels of experience the caster has attained.

Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

However, they are less practiced as casting spells 'raw' than other casters.  As such, their casting level is 1/2 their class level, rounded up.

Advantages:
-
- Efficient Crafting: Starting at level 6, artificers can craft and recharge items at half the cost
Disadvantages:
-  Artificers cast spells at 1/2 their illusionist level.
-  Artificers do not gain an extra slot as normal for a specialist  ~
