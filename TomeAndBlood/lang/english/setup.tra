A wizard may use a Cantrip Wand as a ranged weapon, casting a Magic Bolt at an enemy once per round, which does 1d4+1 magic damage. (Note, while doing so the wizard will be at a tactical disadvantage against nearby attackers using melee weapons.) Alternatively, the wizard can use the wand to cast one of the following cantrips:
- Deflective Shell: blocks one 1st- through 3rd level spell targeting the wizard. The Shell last 3 rounds.
- Conjure Rabbit: conjures a small rodent near the wizard, which lasts for 3 rounds.
- Glimpse: gives the wizard a brief (2-second) look at another area of the map.
- Drowse: the target will fall asleep for 1 round on a failed save vs. Spells.
- Bedazzle: the target suffers a -1 penalty to thac0 and AC for 1 round; on a failed save vs. Breath, the penalties are doubled and last for 2 rounds, and the target is blinded for the first round.
- Stiffen Bones: the target suffers from painful stiffness, suffering a -1 penalty to thac0 and damage for 1 round; on a failed save vs. Death, the penalties are doubled and last for 2 rounds, and the target is Slowed for the first round.

The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled.

Additionally, if the target fails a save vs. spells, the target will be blinded by the Ruby Ray for 3 rounds. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Finally, Pierce Shield will cancel the target's magical combat protections, such as Shield or Stoneskin (but specific protections, such as Resistance to Fire, will remain).

Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.~

This spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed, making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if hit by a Flame Arrow (a 3rd-level spell), the caster will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell of up to 3rd level in power. It excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be reflected back upon the caster. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, a spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed and will exhaust the protection.

This spell will absorb and protect against a total of 5 spell levels of magic directed at the caster. It will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

This spell creates an incredibly powerful barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard is protected by Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), the wizard will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell up to 3rd level in power. 

The Spell Trap is remarkably stable, remaining in place for 4 hours unless dispelled or exhausted. It provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to four missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. The spell fires two missiles at 1st level, three at 5th level, and a maximum of four at 9th level.~

@6099   = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May not place any slots in any fighting style.
– May cast arcane spells.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.

Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell causes the surface of the ground to take on a slippery, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.~

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~
@6113  = ~Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. This spell showers glittering golden particles in the area of effect. Enemies must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts, superheats them, and then hurls fiery bolts at opponents at very high speed. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -4.~

Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a double of the caster formed from pure shadow, and imparts upon it some degree of form and autonomy. Blurry and shapeless, this entity will fight on the caster's behalf and remain in relatively stable form for up to 9 hours (unless it meets a violent demise).~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. The sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. (This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.) The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~

Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster becomes a Grand Master in the use of the weapon. It acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole.  The target creature must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or burst into a million small particles, resembling dust. This effect is instantaneous and irreversible.~

(Necromancy) 

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~
@6128  = ~Protection From Evil
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~
@6129  = ~Glitterdust
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Range: Medium
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. It sprays a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~
@6130  = ~Mirror Image
Level: 3
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~
@6131  = ~Luck
Level: 1
School: Divination
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~
@6132  = ~Flame Arrow
Level: 3
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts (one for every two experience levels, up to a maximum of five arrows at level 10), superheats them, and then hurls them at opponents at very high speed. Each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage plus 2d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. breath at -2. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the wizard, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within range.~

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole. Upon contact, the target must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster, until the spell duration expires or the sword is dispelled. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own once each round, inflicting 5d4 damage when it hits a target. It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it is vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.~

Area of Effect: Special

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently.  These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill.  These effects last for 1 hour.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

When a necromancer uses this ability, a blue glow encompasses his hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d4+1 points of cold damage and must save vs. Death or be Slowed and lose three points of Strength for two rounds. 

Undead touched by this energy are Held for two rounds. They do not receive a savign throw to avoid the effect.~
@6253   = ~Ghoul Touch~
@6254   = ~Ghoul Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch, the spell inflicts 1d4+1 points of magic damage. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. death, the spell continues to do 1d4 damage in the second round and 1d3 damage in the third round. Furthermore, the victim is paralyzed for 1 round and infected with a disease that saps his Strength, Dexterity and Constitution by two points each for five rounds.~
@6255   = ~Vampiric Touch~
@6256   = ~Vampiric Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, his hand is encompassed by a pale blue fire. Anyone successfully attacked by the necromancer loses 1d6+1 hit points, while the necromancer gains 1d6+1 hit points (any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points, lasting for 4 turns). Upon failing a saving throw vs. death with a -2 penalty, the victim loses 1d6 more hit points and also suffers a loss of 3 points of Constitution for one turn. 

Any undead touched by the necromancer while this ability is active are placed under the necromancer's control for five rounds.~

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 1d4+1 points of damage, while the mage gains 1d4+1 hit points. For every three levels of the caster, the draining repeats one round later. The maximum duration of five rounds is reached by 12-level necromancers.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard launches a magical attack against the vitality of an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim's Strength score is automatically reduced by 4 points for the duration of the spell. Additionally, if the target fails a saving throw vs. Death, the Strength penalty is doubled to -8, and the victim suffers the effects of a Slow spell (half movement rate and -4 penalties to thac0 and AC). These effects last for 1 turn.~

This spell creates a rough facsimile of the caster, recognizable though not perfect. The shadow clone has 40% of the caster's hit points and 7-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level.  The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated), and may not cast priest spells.

This spell is cast very quickly, creating a reasonable copy of the caster that can be perceived by all five senses of any onlookers. The clone has 60% of the caster's hit points, and 5-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level. The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated), and may not cast priest spells. The clone can however replicate a moderate amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any spells the caster memorized that day, up to 4th spell level. At the time the clone is created, the caster is rendered invisible for 60 seconds. Onlookers who do not carefully scrutinize the effect might easily believe the clone IS the caster, and the caster may use the distraction to escape or move to some advantageous position.

This is an improvement on the Lesser Simulacrum spell. The clone created has 75% of the caster's hit points, and 3-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level. The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated). The clone can, however replicate a substantial amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any arcane spells the caster memorized that day, up to 7th spell level. Additionally, the clone is so real and has such a sense of identity that it can successfully use divine magic (if the caster has such capabilities). Upon casting, the caster is affected by Improved Invisibility, able to move unnoticed and even attack or cast spells without becoming fully visible.

This spell renders the caster invisible, except for <PRO_HISHER> shadow. Moreover, the shadow can move apart from the caster and, while it cannot perform any actions like attacking or casting spells, it can move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. The caster will be protected by this invisibility as long as the shadow has not been destroyed, but will be rendered visible if the shadow is killed or dispelled.

Upon using this ability, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of his Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% max Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. The wizard chooses three spells that will be released under certain conditions, such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs, all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency.

Upon casting this spell, the caster inscribes a mystical glyph upon a piece of paper or parchment. When this parchment is held near an item enchanted by magic, the glyph briefly glows and imparts knowledge about the item - what it does, how it is activated, and whether it is cursed - to anyone present. 

The Glyph is more durable when inscribed by higher-level casters: it can identify two items at 5th level, three items at 10th level, and four items at 15th level. If unused, the glyph loses it power and fades away after about an hour.~

Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Breath again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. The target suffers 1d4 points of damage, +1 point for each 3 levels of the caster, to a maximum of 1d4+6 points of fire damage. A creature that successfully saves vs. Breath receives half damage.

Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible, except the charmed person cannot be compelled to violence.

If the charmed person is harmed, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed. 

Anyone who has been the target of this spell - whether they make their saving throw or not - will be suspicious for a time, and cannot be affected by it for 8 hours.

This 1st-level spell attempts to temporarily blind its target with a flash of light. A Saving Throw is allowed and, if successful, the target merely suffers a -1 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls, Armor Class, and damage rolls for two rounds. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the victim is also partially blinded, <PRO_HESHE> resulting in reduced range of vision and a -4 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls and Armor Class. This blindness also wears off after two rounds.

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular low-level spells, creates glowing missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. The spell produces one missile at 1st level, two missiles at 3rd level, and three missiles at 9th level.

Similar to Mordenkainen's 'Force Missiles' variant, this is an attempt to improve on the basic Magic Missile spell. This version creates between one and five missiles of sizzling magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4 points of damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage (the victim may save vs. Breath to avoid the fire damage). For every 3 extra levels of experience after 1st level, the wizard gains an additional missile - 2 at 4th level, 3 at 7th level, 4 at 10th level, and a maximum of 5 at 13th level.

The Shield spell will block this, just as it blocks the lesser Magic Missile spell.

@7125  = ~Wand of Magic Missiles~
@7126  = ~When activated, the wand will fire two missiles of magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike the target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the wand ineffective. Each missile will inflict 1d4+1 points of damage.

In addition, the grasp itself does 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply). The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched, the spell's energies have been used.

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 2d3 damage (save vs. Death for half damage), while the caster gains 4 hit points. If the caster goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum hit point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses any extra hit points after 1 turn.

This is less a spell than a release of pure wild energy. Magic energy surrounds wild mages and courses through them. This effect is what happens if a wild mage loses control and allows such energy to be unleashed. There is no spell, no intended form the magic takes; only pure, random, magical manifestation.

Wild mages may release this energy at any time, as often as they like; but most spend their careers learning how to prevent it happening, rather than how to make it happen.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.

Anyone who has been the target of this spell - whether they make their saving throw or not - will be suspicious for a time, and cannot be affected by it for 8 hours.

The caster of this spell gains a temporary insight into the history and nature of magical objects. This translates into a temporary Lore bonus of 20 points, plus an additional 20 points for each five levels of experience the caster has attained.

When this spell is cast, name and enchantments (including curses) of one item or weapon subsequently touched by the caster are revealed without fail. This gives the caster insight into the history, nature, enchantments, and use of the item. Many unidentified items can still be used, but at great risk.

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard, scout, or spy. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

A familiar is more intelligent than others of its type. Its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life, allows it to regenerate 1 hit point per round, and to resist petrification and level drain effects. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

At 1st level, all familiars share the following characteristics: 9 hit points, AC 4, thac0 17, saving throws 16, 25% magic and damage resistance, immunity to level drain and petrification. At certain experience thresholds - 5,000 / 50,000 / 150,000 / 450,000 / 1,250,000 / 2,500,000 / 4,000,000 - the familiar's hit points, AC, thac0 and saving throws will improve.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player may choose:

Pseudo Dragon
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage; save or be Slowed for 2 rounds
- Special Abilities: can cast Blur and Cure Light Wounds, and use a Color Spray breath weapon, once every 3 turns.
- Special Benefit: the pseudodragon's summoner regenerates 1 hit point per round.

Ferret
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage
- Special Abilities: has 80% Pick Pockets score. Can emit a small aura of Nauseating Stench once per turn. For five round, enemies near the ferret must save or suffer 2-point penalties to hit and AC and a 30% chance of casting failure.
- Special Benefit: the ferret's summoner has a +1 bonus to Constitution.

Rabbit
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d2 damage
- Special Abilities: has 80% Detect Traps score. Can burrow into the ground to escape danger - similar to the Shadowstep ability - once per turn.
- Special Benefit: the rabbit's summoner is immune to Slow effects.

Cat
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage
- Special Abilities: has 99% in Move Silently/Hide in Shadows, and is Nondetectable (as the spell) to magic divinations.
- Special Benefit: the cat's summoner has a +1 bonus to Dexterity.

Spider
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d2 damage; save or take 3 poison damage over 1 round
- Special Abilities: can cast a single-target Web, which can tangle the target for 3 rounds, once per 5 rounds.
- Special Benefit: the spider's summoner has an extra chance to resist being affected by poisons.

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures.

A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points). Its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life and prevents it from truly dying. If the familiar should 'die' in combat the caster may cast Find Familiar again a day later to re-summon it.

@8011  = ~Pseudodragon~
@8012  = ~Pseudodragon: this is a tiny, distant relative of full dragons. The pseudodragon can cast Cure Light Wounds, and Blur, and use a colorful 'breath weapon' that mimics the Color Spray spell, once every 3 turns. (At high levels, the Blur improves to a full Improved Invisibility effect.) They can attack twice per round and while their claws are small, they deliver a mild intoxicant which can render the target drowsy and clumsy (mimicking the effects of a Slow spell, for two rounds). 

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner regenerates 1 hit point per round.

As pseudodragons can fly, they are impervious to the effects of Grease, Entangle, Web, and similar spells. As with all familiars, their magical connection to the life force of their master renders them immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8013  = ~Pseudodragon~
@8014  = ~Pseudodragon: pseudodragons are quite intelligent. While small, they are  quick and fairly well-armored. They do not do much damage in combat, but their magical claws are able to render some enemies unconscious. It is also quite resistant to magical spells.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner will slowly regenerate health.

In combat they can attack twice per round, and they can emit a small-range nauseating aura which can cause nearby enemies to gag and retch, resulting in 2-point penalties to hit and armor class, and a 30% chance of spell failure.

Ferrets are also sneaky, and can make effective pickpockets on behalf of their masters.  

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Constitution.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8019  = ~Rabbit~
@8020  = ~Rabbit: while the rabbit is not an impressive combatant, it is exceedingly skilled at avoiding damage. Rabbits have 25% resistance to elemental attacks, and once per turn they can burrow into the ground and move unheeded to a safe area (in practice this resembles the ShadowStep ability of Shadowdancers). Rabbits also have an acute sense of imending danger, and can quite effectively use their sensitive noses and ears to sniff out nearby traps.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner is immune to Slow spells and similar effects.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8021  = ~Cat~
@8022  = ~Cat: a black cat is a very traditional familiar for wizards, and is quite useful as a scout. They can move unseen as well as any master thief; and they may escape notice even in the face of spells that expose invisible creatures (though creatures with the natural ability to see hidden and invisible beings can still spot a cat).

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Dexterity.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8023  = ~Imp~
@8024  = ~Imp: ~
@8025  = ~Spider~
@8026  = ~Spider: a spider can make a useful, if somewhat creepy-crawly, familiar for a wizard with no aversion to arachnids. They are effective in combat, especially against spellcasters, as they inject victims with a poison that can inflict 3 extra points of damage over 6 seconds. This particular variety of large spiders has the ability to, once every 5 rounds, spit a sticky mess of webbing at an enemy, who may be held fast in it for 3 rounds on a failed saving throw.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner has an extra chance to save to avoid spells or effects that cause poison damage.

Spiders cannot be held fast by Web spells or similar effects. As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.

@8028  = ~Mephit: ...~
@8029  = ~Quasit~
@8030  = ~Quasit: ...~
@8031  = ~Rat~
@8032  = ~Rat: rats are unusually intelligent and sociable creatures, especially when enhanced by the magic of this spell. Once per 3 turns, this familiar may call upon 1d6 fellow rats to join it in combat. Rats, even domesticated ones are also no strangers to garbage and disease, and may utilize this against their enemies. Each time they successfully strike an enemy, the victim may become diseased, resulting in a short period of weakness and a 25% chance of spell failure.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Intelligence.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.

@8203  = ~Imbue Familiar~
@8204  = ~Add this spell to the familiar~
@8205  = ~Choose a different spell~
@8206  = ~Imbue Familiar

This ability can be used to imbue a familiar with the ability to cast spells. The spells are chosen from those known by the caster.  A 1st-level spell may be imbued when the caster is level 1; a 2nd-level or lower spell at level 3; a 3rd-level or lower spell at level 6; a 4th-level or lower spell at level 10, and a 5th-level or lower spell at level 15. 

Once a familiar is imbued with the ability to cast a spell, it will be able to cast the spell once per combat encounter. Each time a familier is so imbued, the choice is permanent and cannot be undone.

@21902  = ~Arcanist~
@21903  = ~ARCANIST: Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic through intense study; others are born with magic in their blood. Arcanists seek to meld the science of wizardly scholars with the natural might of innate casters. An arcanist must prepare <PRO_HISHER> spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, <PRO_HISHER> spells are not expended when they are cast. Instead, <PRO_HESHE> can cast any spell that <PRO_HESHE> has prepared, consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level.

Advantages:
- May learn any arcane spell from scrolls, as wizards do.
- After preparing spells and resting, may cast spells spontaneously, just as a sorcerer does.

Disadvantages: 
- May not specialize in a school of magic, as traditional wizards can.
- Items that increase spell slots, like a Ring of Wizardry, can only increase an Arcanist's casting slots by one at each spell level.
~
@21981 = ~Initialize Arcanist Spellcasting~
@21982 = ~Change Memorized Spells~
@21983 = ~Spell Preparation

This ability allows the Arcanist to change which spells are prepared for the next day. Upon using the ability, memorization slots will become available in the Arcanist's spellbook, and spellcasting will be disabled. After deciding which spells to memorize, the Arcanist must rest for 8 hours. Upon waking, spellcasting will be re-enabled, and the Arcanist will be unable to modify the contents of his memorization slots until the next time this ability is used.

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

Chaos Shield increases a Wild Mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a Wild Surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the Wild Surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with the Wild Mage's level bonus.~

@115119 =  ~This deadly wand was crafted by the wizard Hegthen to protect him from his rival's fire-using minions. Hegthen made frequent use of the wand during his protracted war with his enemy. After ten years of hounding, Hegthen decided to take the battle to his rival, defeating him in one of the most spectacular magical duels ever seen in Suzail's history. As his terms of victory, Hethgen demanded that his enemy's name be magically snuffed out of the memory of all who knew him. His enemy accepted and later went on to become the Cloaked Flame, a dangerous terrorist killed by Cormyrean Purple Dragons and War Wizards in 1212 DR.
