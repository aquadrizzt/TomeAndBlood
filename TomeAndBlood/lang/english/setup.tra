@6098   = ~Sorcerer~
@6099   = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May not place any slots in any fighting style.
– May cast arcane spells.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.

@6256   = ~Vampiric Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, his hand is encompassed by a pale blue fire. Anyone successfully attacked by the necromancer loses 1d6+1 hit points, while the necromancer gains 1d6+1 hit points (any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points, lasting for 4 turns). Upon failing a saving throw vs. death with a -2 penalty, the victim loses 1d6 more hit points and also suffers a loss of 3 points of Constitution for one turn. 

Any undead touched by the necromancer while this ability is active are placed under the necromancer's control for five rounds.~

Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 1d4+1 points of damage, while the mage gains 1d4+1 hit points. For every three levels of the caster, the draining repeats one round later. The maximum duration of five rounds is reached by 12-level necromancers.

If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.~
@6262   = ~Ray of Enfeeblement~
@6263   = ~Ray of Enfeeblement
Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: vs. Death

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard launches a magical attack against the vitality of an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim's Strength score is automatically reduced by 4 points for the duration of the spell. Additionally, if the target fails a saving throw vs. Death, the Strength penalty is doubled to -8, and the victim suffers the effects of a Slow spell (half movement rate and -4 penalties to thac0 and AC). These effects last for 1 turn.

@6351 = ~Contingency~
@6352 = ~Contingency

Upon using this ability, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of his Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% max Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. The wizard chooses three spells that will be released under certain conditions, such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs, all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency.

Instead, <PRO_HESHE> can cast any spell that <PRO_HESHE> has prepared, consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level.

Advantages:
- May learn any arcane spell from scrolls, as wizards do.
- After preparing spells and resting, may cast spells spontaneously, just as a sorcerer does.

Disadvantages:

Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

However, they are less practiced as casting spells 'raw' than other casters.  As such, their casting level is 1/2 their class level, rounded up.

Advantages:
-
- Efficient Crafting: Starting at level 6, artificers can craft and recharge items at half the cost
Disadvantages:
-  Artificers cast spells at 1/2 their illusionist level.
-  Artificers do not gain an extra slot as normal for a specialist  ~
